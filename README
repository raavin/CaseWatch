## Information

### History

I originally developed an application in [version 1 of rails](http://github.com/raavin/frontyard). After a big break from any coding, I decided to upgrade the application to [Rails 2](http://github.com/raavin/Client_Management_Application). Unfortunately, now there has been a massive break. We are up to Rails 4 and I have let things slide. I am hoping that upgrading this application will train me again the way of rails and I am looking forward to getting my teeth into things again.
